[This](https://github.com/pbrucla/PBR-Onboarding-And-Resources) guide from our friends at UCLA is probably the best way to get started, but here are some tools that we personally use.

## Steganography
* RX-SSTV (anything beep related)
* Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit (relies on Java)

## Cryptography
* [Cryptii](cryptii.com)
* [DCode](dcode.fr) (for niche bases)
* rapidtables (for common bases)
* CyberChef (bruteforce)

## Forensics
* FTK Imager (or Autopsy)
* 7-Zip

## VMs
* [Apache Guacamole](guac.baycyber.net) <- not the most reliable, but can help if you are on a Chromebook
* VirtualBox + Parrot OS

## Network
* Wireshark (for Packet Tracer)
* Proton/SoftEther VPN

## Reverse Engineering
* Ghidra
